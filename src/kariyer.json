  "text": "My interest in electrical-electronic projects and software was an important factor in getting to know PLC, which started in my vocational high school period, and choosing and loving my profession of programming with PLC.I have been working on panel design, manufacturing and PLC on e-plan for about 1 year.I have been in the field in many companies. For 6 months, I took training in the software part and worked on AR and I made a face recognition system project using the python language. I have been working on web design front-end for 2 months. I am looking for an environment where I can effectively apply my knowledge and the knowledge I will gain in the future, within the engineering discipline, in the rise of my organization."
